# XML Cinema Project  

## Project Title & Description  
This project represents a cinema movie database using XML and DTD.  
It shows how to define complex structures such as multiple genres, optional ratings, and nested elements like a movie cast.  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xml-cinema-project.git
   cd xml-cinema-project
   ```
2. Open `movies.xml` with any XML editor (for example VS Code, Notepad++, Oxygen).  
3. Validate it against `movies.dtd`. Most editors support automatic validation.  
4. Try adding a new movie to test the DTD rules.
